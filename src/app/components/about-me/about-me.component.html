            Allow me to introduce myself - I am Max, a dedicated professional in the field of software development. My journey began in November 2021 when I started my career at Startup Werk. Over the years, I have honed my expertise in crafting top-notch web applications and collaborating harmoniously with our esteemed cooperation partners. In addition to my role as a software developer, I have also taken on the responsibilities of a Scrum Master since April 2023. This new role has allowed me to lead the expansion and optimization of processes within my team, ensuring that we operate at the pinnacle of efficiency and productivity. I take immense pride in my ability to tackle complex challenges, adapt to dynamic environments, and foster a cooperative work culture.
